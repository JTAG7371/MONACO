MONACO
==========

IW4x +10 bolts-only sniper mod featuring weapons from the newest Call of Duty games only.

Server hosters should divide their score limit by 10 if it's a kill-based gamemode (e.g. TDM 7500 should be 750, FFA 1500 should be 150) to match the +10 scores.

Server hosters can also toggle +10 mode, prematch period, and ghillie suits at the top of `scripts\game\hooks.gsc`.
